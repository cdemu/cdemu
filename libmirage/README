libMirage
ver.1.6.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is libMirage library, a CD-ROM image access library, and part of the
userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux. It is
written in C and based on GLib.

The aim of libMirage is to provide uniform access to the data stored in
different image formats, by creating a representation of disc stored in image
file, which is based on GObjects. There are various objects that represent
different parts of the disc; disc, session, track, sector, etc. In addition to
providing access to data provided by the image file, libMirage is also capable
of generating some of the data that might not be present in image file. For
instance, ISO image provides only user data from sector, without sync pattern,
header, ECC/EDC codes or subchannel. When this missing data is requested,
libMirage will transparently generate it.

Currently supported image formats:
 - BlindWrite 5/6 (B5T, B6T) file format
 - Roxio / WinOnCD (C2D) file format
 - CloneCD (CCD, SUB, IMG) image format
 - DiscJuggler (CDI) file format
 - Easy CD Creator (CIF) file format
 - CDRwin (CUE, BIN) image format
 - PowerISO (DAA) image format
 - Track loader (ISO, UDF) for ISO9660 and UDF track images
 - Alcohol 120% (MDS) image format
 - Nero Burning ROM (NRG) image format
 - ReadCD (TOC, BIN) image format
 - Cdrdao's (TOC, BIN) image format
 - XCDRoast (TOC, BIN) image format

libMirage has a plug-in based system, which allows a simple addition of new
image format parsers or data-file access fragments. It also supports runtime
debugging via debug traces; there are special debug context objects that can
be attached to other objects and used to control the amount of verbosity.
