1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is cdemu-client, a simple command-line client for controlling CDEmu daemon.
It is part of the cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator
for linux.

It provides a way to perform the key tasks related to controlling the CDEmu
daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying devices' status and
retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.


2. Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - CMake >= 3.16
 - IntlTool >= 0.21
 - GetText >= 0.15

 - Python >= 3.8
 - PyGObject >= 3.0.0

 - GLib, GIO >= 2.28 GIR


3. Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please read the INSTALL file.


4. Usage examples:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read cdemu-client's man page or run 'cdemu -h' for more information on commands
and their syntax.

Loading a single image to first device:
 cdemu load 0 ~/image.mds

Loading multiple-file image to first device:
 cdemu load 0 ~/session1.toc ~/session2.toc ~/session3.toc

Loading a text-based image in non-ASCII/non-Unicode encoding:
 cdemu load 0 ~/image.cue --encoding=windows-1250

Loading an encrypted image:
 cdemu load 0 ~/image.daa

if image is actually encrypted, the client will query the user for the password.
If started on a terminal it will use that, else it will use the program specified
by the environment variable SSH_ASKPASS. On most systems this variable will
already have been configured. It is possible to override this for
non-interactive setups by using the environment variable CDEMU_ASKPASS.

 CDEMU_ASKPASS="/bin/echo -n plainpassword" cdemu load 0 ~/cdimage.daa

NOTE THAT THIS WILL LEAK YOUR PASSWORD AND IS THEREFORE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

Loading a raw image of a CSS-encrypted DVD created by 'dd', so it can be played by mplayer:
 cdemu load 0 ~/image.iso
 cdemu dvd-report-css 0 1

Creating a blank recordable disc: DVD+R SL with ISO image writer:
 cdemu create-blank --writer-id=WRITER-ISO --medium-type=dvd+r 0 ~/output-image.iso

Creating a blank recordable disc: 80-minute CD-R with TOC image writer, with additional writer parameters:
 cdemu create-blank --writer-id=WRITER-TOC --medium-type=cdr80 --param="writer.write_raw=1" --param="writer.write_subchannel=1" 0 ~/output-image.toc

Unloading first device:
 cdemu unload 0
