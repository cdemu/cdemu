Description: GNOME application to control CDEmu daemon
 This is gCDEmu, a GNOME application for controlling CDEmu daemon. It is part of
 the CDEmu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for Linux.
 .
 It provides a graphic interface that allows performing the key tasks related to
 controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying
 devices' status and retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.
 .
 In addition, the application listens to the signals emitted by CDEmu daemon and
 provides the notification via libnotify's notifications (provided that Python
 bindings are installed).
