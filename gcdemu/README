gCDEmu
v.1.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is gCDEmu, a GNOME applet for controlling CDEmu daemon. It is part of the
userspace-cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

It provides a graphic interface that allows performing the key tasks related to
controlling the CDEmu daemon, such as loading and unloading devices, displaying
devices' status and retrieving/setting devices' debug masks.

In addition, the applet listens to signals emitted by CDEmu daemon and provides
notifications via libnotify (provided that python bindings are installed).


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - python 2.4 or newer
 - PyGTK, PyGObject and PyGNOME 2.6 or newer;
   (gnomeapplet and gconf modules are required)
 - D-BUS python bindings
 - intltool

 - notify-python (optional)


Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation process is generic ./configure, make, make install as described in
INSTALL file.


Note that if during make, you get the following error:
    make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/gcdemu-1.1.0/po'
    file=`echo sl | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
    && rm -f $file && -o $file sl.po
    /bin/sh: -o: not found
    make[1]: *** [sl.gmo] Error 127
it means you don't have intltool installed.


Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: gCDEmu's tray icon is greyed and the applet does nothing!
A: Greyed-out icon means that the applet failed to connect to the CDEmu daemon.
   Please make sure the daemon is running and that you're connecting via
   appropriate bus.

A note on encrypted images and password supplying:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of version 1.2.0, CDEmu daemon offers support for encrypted images. When password
is required to load an image, gCDEmu will prompt for it and then send it to daemon.

NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE PASSWORD IS SENT OVER D-BUS IN A PLAIN STRING FORM, WITHOUT
ANY PROTECTION. DEPENDING ON YOUR PRIVACY CONCERNS YOU MIGHT WISH TO AVOID LOADING
SUCH IMAGES.
