Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the kernel module and other files. 
     (Needs root permission)

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

Compilers and Options
=====================

You can explicitly specify the kernel for which to compile the module for
by setting the environment variable KERNELRELEASE. The default if it is not
specified is 'uname -r' in other words your running kernel.

It is also possible to set extra compiler flags through the EXTRA_CFLAGS 
environment variable.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

This device driver was initially developed for use on 32 bit intel compatible
processor architectures but may with differing levels of success be compiled
for other kinds of processor architectures.
