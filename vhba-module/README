This is VHBA (Virtual SCSI Host Bus adapter), a Linux kernel module which
acts as a low-level SCSI driver and which provides the SCSI layer with a
virtual SCSI adapter which can have multiple virtual devices. It is part of
the cdemu suite, a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.
It is written in C.

Its typical use in the CDEmu software suite is to provide virtual devices
that emulates real SCSI Optical (CD-ROM) devices. It works in cooperation with

is just a copy of the information stored on an actual disc.
