Description: CDEmu daemon
 This is CDEmu daemon, the daemon part of the CDEmu suite,
 a free, GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for Linux.
 .
 It receives SCSI commands from kernel module and processes them, passing the
 requested data back to the kernel. Daemon implements the actual virtual
 device; one instance per each device registered by kernel module. It uses
 libMirage, an image access library that is part of CDEmu suite, for
 the image access (e.g. sector reading).
 .
 The daemon registers itself on D-BUS' system or session bus (depending on the
 options passed to it) where it exposes an interface that can be used by
 clients to control it.
